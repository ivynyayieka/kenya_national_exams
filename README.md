# Hypothesis tests for the impact of election years on Kenya's national examination results 

##### Is there a difference between the top scores of candidates in Kenya's national examinations on years when there is an election compared to years where there is none?


#### Null hypothesis:
There is no difference between the top scores of candidates in Kenya's national examinations on years when there is an election compared to years where there is none.

ðŸ‘‰ Summary

In this project, I plot the percent of candidates that got high scores in their KCPE and KCSE exams. 

ðŸ‘‰ Reflection

What I can conclude based on this analysis:
* This project is helpful for seeing the percent of candidates that got the highest scores in their exams by year.
* It appears that it is possible that the election years are not very influential on the  scores in the top band,
* The plotting however reveals that the percentage of candidates making the highest scores are roughly distributed in two different clusters, meaning something other than the election years could be significantly affecting the percentage of top scorers. (Note: In preliminary analysis in the scratchpad, it appeared cabinet secretaries were more influential in the kinds of results candidates got than election years)


What I can't conclude based on this chart: 
* I do not have a sense of whether the ditfference between the scores in the election years and those in the non-election years is significant. For that, I will need a t-test. 
* Since it is possible other variables are affecting the distribution, I do not know yet which variable could be affecting the top scores.
